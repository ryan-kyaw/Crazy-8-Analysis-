# Crazy-8-Analysis

In this project, myself and a few of my classmates played the iOS Gamepigeon game of Crazy 8 (very similar game to UNO) many times to analyze if there was a correlation between starting hands and winning the game.

We wanted to see if a player was more likely to win a game if they had more wild-cards in the beginning of their hand.
